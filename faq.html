							<div class="row faq-row">
								<p>Fire trucks will accompany ambulances on medical emergencies for several reasons. Depending on where the nearest ambulance is located, it is often possible for a truck company to arrive before the ambulance to initiate patient care. If there are many simultaneous calls for medical assistance, an ambulance may need to come from the other side of town to provide help. In this case, the closest fire truck would be sent to initiate patient care until the ambulance crew arrives. Firefighters in Waterloo are cross-trained as medical service professionals as well as being firefighters. In fact, the majority of department members have been trained to the highest level of prehospital care, referred to as a paramedic. </p>

								<p>We would welcome a visit to any of our stations for this purpose. In years past, several members of the department were certified for carseat installation but funding for the program has since gone unrenewed. Be sure to check with the manufacturer of the carseat as well as the car manufacturer: not all combinations may be possible. Purchasing used carseats (with an unknown history) is ill advised as structural damage to the carseat may be present but not visible. <a href="safety.html#carseat">...More</a>

							<div class="row faq-row">
								<p>Operators of emergency vehicles (ambulances and fire apparatus) expect drivers to pull as far to the right as possible. This allows the emergency vehicle to negotiate traffic most expediently and for traffic to return back to normal as quickly as possible. Much as it is for a passenger vehicle, <i>passing</i> on the right is very dangerous for emergency vehicles.</p><p>If a driver finds it impossible to pull to the right, it is best to just stop in place and switch on the hazard lights (flashers) to acknowledge the presence of the emergency vehicle. Drivers are required to yield to emergency vehicles if emergency lights are flashing.</p>

								<p>Recreational fires that use clean, natural materials (e.g., dried logs) are permitted in the city. Smoky fires, including those that use leaves as fuel, are considered a nuisance by the City of Waterloo. Owing to the health hazard of inhaled smoke, the city has issued an ordinance against fires that generate smoke, are too large, or use non-natural materials as fuel. The burning of wet wood or other natural materials is in violation of this ordinance. Yard waste can be disposed either using the city's curbside service or at the dropoff location at 3505 Easton Avenue (April through November).</p>

Overnight hours are spent at the station, and calls for service are promptly answered as they are during the day. Between running calls, crews spend their time training, conducting vehicle checks, cleaning the station and apparatus, and inspecting equipment.</p>

								<p class="few-p">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.></p>

							<h3>Our Vision</h3>
							<p class="ourvision">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content</p>
							<p class="ourvision1">of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less</p>
							<p class="ourvision2">normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
							<p class="ourvision3">over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</p>
							<p class="ourvision4">Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text</p>
							<p class="ourvision5">over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
